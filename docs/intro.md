# Deep Learning Glossary

This glossary aims to document some of the common terms and techniques used in Deep Learning today. It is an ever evolving list of topics.

This was inspired by a list of [30 papers](https://arc.net/folder/D0472A20-9C20-4D3F-B145-D2865C0A9FEE) that were recommended reading in April 2024 as well as the [Machine & Deep Learning Compendium](https://github.com/orico/www.mlcompendium.com/)
